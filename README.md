Initial version last updated on July 10, 2019 by Professor Gary Gray and formerly found at https://sites.esm.psu.edu/~gray/psu-latex-thesis-class.html

# Note 1: Using for your dissertation

To use this as your dissertation, download the entire repository as a .zip file and place it all into one folder before using it. **I would not recommend cloning this directory.** This directory will exist primarily to make sure a version is pubilcly available.

# Note 2: Future changes

While the initial version of this thesis template is based on Dr. Gray's work, future changes might be made to the class file and documents to account for changes in formatting and content. If you know of an issue to work on, use the Issues tab to let me know, and if you have suggested changes according to changes in Penn State's required format, please use the pull requests function.
